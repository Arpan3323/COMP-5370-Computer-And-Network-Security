Parses an invalid nosj object and does not throw errors. The root cause is, component "splitCommasButPreserveMaps" does not account for the case 
where the last char in the text is a comma.

Can be fixed by modifying the component "splitCommasButPreserveMaps". When the loop iterates through the text and checks if the current char is a 
comma, if it is, it should then check if this is also the last char in the text, i.e char == text[-1]. If it is, then it should throw an error and 
exit the program. This will prevent the program from parsing invalid nosj object.

Considers a valid empty simple string as invalid when the input is <<a:s>>. The root cause is the regex defined in the component "validateSimpleString" 
is incorrect.

This is caused due to the regex that validates a simple string returning False as it expects that trailing "s" in the value must be preceeded by 
commonly-used ascii characters (i.e. all ascii letters and numbers, spaces ("" / 0x20), and tabs ("\t", 0x09)). The way to fix this is by changing 
the regex to "[ASCII-Characters]*s" from "[ASCII-Characters]+s" as "+" means one or more and "*" means zero or more
